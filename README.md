# Bearing Fault Diagnosis using Envelope Analysis

This project uses vibration data from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center. It analyzes both healthy and faulty bearing conditions by applying Envelope Amplitude Demodulation to accurately extract fault frequencies. The results are visualized using FFT and time-domain plots with `matplotlib`.

## Key Features
- Signal preprocessing and FFT analysis
- Envelope detection for fault frequency extraction
- Interactive and static visualizations for comparison
- Based on CWRU bearing dataset (Normal & Inner Race Faults)
